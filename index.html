        Welcome, this is my 4th Quarter Portfolio where I will be sharing various experiences I had this year.

  <p> 
      There are many things that happened during this quarter, it may have been a short month but in retrospect, each second that I spent during this month was able to shape me 
      into the person I am today. There might have been moments I regret and there might've been things I really shouldn't have done. But all of the negative things that happened 
      is able to teach me and make me grow and mature into a much more better person. Of course, it wasn't only my efforts that affected me, there has been many people that I love 
      and cherish that helped me throughout this time period, and without them I don't think I would've been able to mature as much as I did today. To those people, I love all of you
      and I am forever grateful for the sacrifices we have made and will be made in the upcoming years together.
